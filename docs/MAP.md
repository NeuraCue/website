## Claude Terminal

- [Quickstart](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart)
- install, `claude doctor`, auth

## Claude Rules

- First think through a problem, read codebase for relevant files, and write plan to tasks/todo.md
- Plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
- Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan
- Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go
- Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
- Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible
    - we want to avoid making any massive or complex changes
    - every change should impact as little code as possible
    - everything is about simplicity
