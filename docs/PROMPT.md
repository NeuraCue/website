I want you to help me write a spec file for a project I am building. It's called "hookhub", It's 
a place where cool open source claude hooks are displayed and browsed. Search on Claude hooks 
and write an initial spec for this. Remember it's an MVP ATM and we need only the functionality 
of displaying the hooks. Hooks are found in github repositories, they have name, category, 
description and link to the repo. The main page should display the hooks in a grid like view.
```

```
Can you please now implement the main page grid as specified in @memory/spec/SPEC.md
```
