## LLMs

- Claude
- ChatGPT
- LLMs:
    - large language models which are AI systems capable of understanding and generating human
      language by processing vast amounts of data
    - able to grasp meanings, nuances, and even subtle implications
    - able to pick up on the smallest bits of context to provide an accurate answer

## IDE

- Replit

## Frontend Focus

- V0: AI tool focused on frontend

## AI-Based IDE

- Agents -> https://cursor.com/agents
- Cursor -> https://cursor.com/
- Dashboard -> https://cursor.com/dashboard

## App Types

- Website -> basic, fixed content, catch-all
- Web App -> complex, interactive & functional, runs in browser
- Native Mobile App -> built for iOS/Android only, fast & efficient
- Hybrid App -> mix of native mobile app & web app, native app shell on wep app tech

## Next.js

- Built on top of React, blurs lines between frontend & backend
- Includes server-side rendering (SSR) & static site generation (SSG)
- Includes API Routes
- Works well with serverless architectures
- Provides tools to interact with databases but does not replace them
- Does not provide persistent data storage, all data is temporary
- You need an external database (PostgreSQL) for handling user authentication or data

## Considerations

- Ask the Right Questions
    - It is key to have a basic understanding of code and how it works to start prompting AI
    - It is important to know questions to ask when the code does not work
- Keep in Mind What You Have Built So Far
    - Sometimes AI will forget and rewrite functions
    - Do not mindlessly copy and paste code that AI provides
    - Know what you have in your codebase
- Audit with AI
    - AI likes editing sections of code, especially when trying to navigate usage limits
    - Have AI completely audit your entire codebase every so often
- Know AI Limits
    - Always make sure placeholder values are filled out and match where they need to
        - AI won't generate sensitive data for you, you have to input this yourself
    - AI cannot run any programs in the terminal or install packages
- Be Careful Double-Checking
    - AI is not always the best at double-checking their work
    - Sometimes it may cause more issues than solutions
- One Step At a Time
    - Add features one step at a time
    - This allows backups to revert to if AI breaks your code
    - AI works better in segments
    - Take it slow and you will be rewarded
